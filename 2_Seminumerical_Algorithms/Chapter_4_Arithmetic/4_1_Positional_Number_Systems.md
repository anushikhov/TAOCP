### Arithmetic  

## Positional Number Systems  

**It is important to make a thorough study of efficient methods for calculating with numbers, since arithmetic underlines so many computer applications.**  

In  this chapter, we shall analyze algorithms for doing arithmetic operations on many types of quantities, such as "floating point" numbers, extremely large numbers, rational numbers, polynomials, and power series; and we will also discuss related topics such as radix conversion, factoring of numbers, and the evaluation of polynomials.   

THE WAY WE DO ARITHMETIC is intimately related to the way we represent the numbers we deal with.   

**Positional notation using base b (or radix b) is defined by the rule**  

$$(...a_3a_2a_1a_0.a_{-1}a_{-2}...)_b = ... + a_3b^3 + a_2b^2 + a_1b^1 + a_0 + a_{-1}b^{-1} + a_{-2}b^{-2} + ...$$
